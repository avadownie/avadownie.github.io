                <li>Angel Hair<ul>
                <li>Angel hair pasta is a long, thin noodle with a rounded shape. 
                    Although it resembles spaghetti – another long, 
                    thin pasta – angel hair is much finer. 
                    This delicate shape is best used with simple, 
                    light sauces and vegetables, such as pesto sauce or a primavera dish.</li>
                  </ul></li>  
                <li>Bow Tie<ul>
                    <li>Bow tie pasta, also called farfalle, 
                        is a pasta shape with scalloped edges pinched in the middle.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li>Elbow<ul>
                        <li>The iconic elbow pastas—often called macaroni in North America—are cut 
                            into narrow, curved tube shapes. Most well known for their use in mac and 
                            cheese, elbows are versatile, familiar and well suited for use in many 
                            sauce- and soup-based recipes.</li>
